        <h2>Applications of the Gesture-Controlled Movable Bot</h2>
        <div class="text-section">
            <p>Our gesture-controlled movable bot has a wide range of real-world applications, making it a versatile tool for various industries and environments. Here are some key areas where this technology can be applied:</p>
    
            <h3>1. Industrial Automation</h3>
            <p>In manufacturing environments, gesture-controlled bots can assist with handling materials or performing repetitive tasks in confined spaces. Workers can control machines from a safe distance, improving workplace safety and efficiency. These bots are ideal for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Remote handling in hazardous environments.</li>
                <li>Performing tasks in areas unsafe for humans, such as extreme temperatures or exposure to chemicals.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h3>2. Assistive Technology for Disabled Individuals</h3>
            <p>Gesture-controlled bots can enhance accessibility by allowing individuals with physical disabilities to control devices without relying on traditional remote controls or buttons. Simple hand movements can operate household appliances or robotic arms, offering greater independence.</p>
    
            <h3>3. Search and Rescue Operations</h3>
            <p>In disaster zones, remote-controlled bots can reach areas too dangerous for human rescuers. Gesture control allows rescuers to guide the bot with intuitive hand movements, making navigation through rubble or collapsed structures more efficient. Potential uses include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Surveying dangerous terrain.</li>
                <li>Delivering supplies to trapped individuals.</li>
                <li>Performing initial inspections in hazardous conditions.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h3>4. Robotics Education</h3>
            <p>Gesture-controlled bots are an excellent tool for teaching robotics, programming, and control systems. Students can gain hands-on experience with cutting-edge technologies such as gesture recognition and robotics, fostering interest in STEM fields. Key educational applications include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Demonstrating real-time control systems.</li>
                <li>Teaching sensor integration and automation.</li>
                <li>Encouraging innovation in robotics competitions.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h3>5. Entertainment and Gaming</h3>
            <p>The entertainment industry can leverage gesture-controlled bots for interactive gaming experiences, allowing players to control characters or devices in a more immersive way. Potential gaming and entertainment applications include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Augmented reality (AR) or virtual reality (VR) games where users interact through gestures.</li>
                <li>Interactive exhibitions in museums or theme parks.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h3>6. Military and Defense</h3>
            <p>Gesture-controlled bots can be utilized for remote surveillance and tactical support in military operations. They can operate in hostile environments while minimizing risk to personnel. Some potential uses in defense include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Surveillance in high-risk areas.</li>
                <li>Bomb disposal or hazardous material handling.</li>
                <li>Remote weaponized systems controlled through gestures.</li>
            </ul>
